    "description": "The image shows a JavaScript code snippet for the `startRecording` async function in the 'audio-frontend' application. This function is responsible for initializing an AudioContext and a custom audio processing script, accessing the user's microphone, and setting up nodes for real-time frequency analysis and audio processing. It handles visualization, silence detection, and facilitates transcription by connecting various audio nodes. Additionally, the code includes error handling for the audio setup process."

    "description": "The image showcases a flowchart on a black background, outlined in purple and bordered by a green frame, illustrating a voice interface system. Central to this system are the components involved in voice-to-voice AI interactions, informed by language model advancements. Starting from the 'User' speaking, audio is processed through the 'User Interface' and 'Backend Server.' The audio then undergoes transcription via 'OpenAI Whisper / Groq Whisper,' converting it to text. This text is processed by 'Chat Completion OpenAI Chat API,' with the response being synthesized back into audio through 'Text-to-Speech OpenAI TTS / ElevenLabs TTS.' The process accommodates error handling, highlighting its robustness. This diagram effectively outlines the seamless integration of speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies, emphasizing the evolving nature of AI-driven voice communications."
